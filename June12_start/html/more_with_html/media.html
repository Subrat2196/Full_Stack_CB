    <!-- Here if we write just this <video src="media/video.mp4"></video> then we need to explicitly play the video on the 
        web browser after writing controls in video, then only it will have the video 
        In preload if we select metadata then the browser will have no info about the video until it is played
    We have autoplay in video but modern browsers disable the fuctionality due to the reason that if we enable autoplay and
    disble the controls there is no way to stop the audio other than muting the browser -->

    <video src="media/video.mp4" controls loop preload="auto"></video>
    <audio src="media/audio.mp3" controls></audio>
