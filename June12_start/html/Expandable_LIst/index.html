    <!--Here what we are trying to do is rather than showing the inside elements we only want to show them whenever 
    we hover over the list elements-> we can do things like setting the visibility for ul inside ul
    we can do this li:hover > ul{ visibility:visible} //It means that ul which is directly inside the list which is hovered

    We in the css file will write    ul ol {} It means inside ul there is an ol
    We can also do as li > ol which means only the ol which are inside the li will be colored

    These types are called CSS combinators--> 
    <ul>
        <li> Item1
            <ol>
                <li>Hey there you know ne</li>
                <li>I am here to do my best</li>
                <li>Come back now i drive every
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inside list</li>
                        <li>inside list</li>
                        <li>inside list</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li> Item2
